# N315: Final Project

##

This project will test your ability to work as a team with a larger project. It will also test your skills working remotely with Github. You need to focus on user feedback as well. This site must be fully responsive for desktops and tablets, 1024Ã—768, and must be a fully working CRUD application.

For the CRUD part of your team's app, you can use a JSON string stored in memory or for those that can use local storage or Firebase please use that and make this a fully working application anyone can use. For the CRUD you must be able to create a recipe, delete the recipe, display all recipes and update a recipe. If you can not do any of that this is not a CRUD application. You must have user feedback i.e. have alerts showing when loading data or something happens, so the user knows something is wrong or successful.
